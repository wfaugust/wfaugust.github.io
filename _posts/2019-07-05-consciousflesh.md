Being in a relationship makes me anxious. The origin of the anxiety is probably that I will always be stuck in a dilemma of losing myself or feeling my ego being violated. I failed to keep it proportional. Susan Sontag said consciousness is harnessed to the flesh, and I couldn't agree more. What I have is more of a vivid experience. When I thought I was sober and rational, I rejected sex and food. One day when I was sitting in a dining hall having my dinner and watching people foraging in groups, suddenly I felt a little bit disgusted. With such an appearance of beings, human has really made no progress in the past few thousand years, and we are still primitive mammals.)

It seems that I can only appreciate those who are extremely disciplined and abstinent. Strict diet, strict routine with prudent socializing. This kind of life that makes me more inclined doesn't seem to be out of self-choice. Simply by nature. Maybe it is, maybe not. If there is a reason for my appreciation of strict self-discipline, it may be the influence of a friend. His stone-like character impressed me. It's hard for me to tell if his character was shaped by his family no matter whether he was willing or not, all I know is that I was reluctantly influenced by him in the days we know each other. Often, I hate getting along with people. Even with those that I am familiar with, a meal puts me on pins and needles. Those trivial talks only consume me, and so does eating. I'm not interested in any topic; I'm not interested in good or bad food. But I can't keep silent at the table. Of course, if I'm hungry, I'll eat as hard as I can. Often after a meal, I feel exhausted. I have no idea when I got sick and had such symptoms. The only thing I know is that after realizing my sickness, I didn't even bother to use my language skills for a while. I try to get back a little bit of the dregs of thought and self-awareness from books and classical music. Just as I force myself to fall asleep when I have insomnia, I force myself to read and write regularly and listen to lengthy classics. a few indeed comfort me, while most are of no use.

Reading Mrs. Dalloway this week, I saw Woolf's repeated references to Shakespeare that I quoted below:
"Love between man and woman was repulsive to Shakespeare."
"How Shakespeare loathed humanityâ€”the putting on of clothes, the getting of children, the sordidity of the mouth and the belly! "
I feel relieved. If it is Shakespeare who quietly built up my knowledge about this world, that's fine. So, love is pure love, and glory is bright glory. To be honest, not only do I seldom talk about literature, but I seldom talk about what is love and glory with ease. Did I ever think that whether I have so-called values and a worldview?

One night in March, I was reading another book at home alone and patiently finishing the last page. At that moment, I felt a collapse and a kind of satisfaction from nothingness. It was almost like falling unconscious in an orgasm. While I can't tell whether orgasm is really a great harmony of oneself, I only clearly remember that night I am so satisfied with my whole life that I shall have no desire anymore.
Well, hope one day I can be cured and recovered.
