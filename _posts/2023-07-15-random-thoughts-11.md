Your breath is sweet.    
你氣若幽蘭，

Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.    
雙眼宛若蒼穹的寶石，

Your back is straight your hair is smooth.          
你後背順直，

On the pillow where you lie.    
秀髮婉轉，摩挲枕際。

But I don"t sense affection.    
可我感受不到你的深情，

No gratitude or love.   
不見感激，未覺愛意，

Your loyalty is not to me.    
你的忠貞從未施與給我，

But to the stars above.    
而是留給了天上的星辰。

****

By Bob Dylan
