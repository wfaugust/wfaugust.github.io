**Indian Camp**

“This lady is going to have a baby, Nick,” he said.

“I know,” said Nick.

“You don’t know,” said his father. “Listen to me. What she is going through is called being in labor. The baby wants to be born and she wants it to be born. All her muscles are trying to get the baby born. That is what is happening when she screams.”

“I see,” Nick said.

 

**The Doctor and the Doctor’s Wife**

“Remember, that he who ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city,” said his wife.

“记住，控制自己精神的人比夺取一座城的人更伟大，”他的妻子说道。

 

**The Three-Day Blow**

“He says opening bottles is what makes drunkards,” Bill explained.

比尔解释说：“他说开酒瓶是导致醉汉的原因。”

“That’s right,” said Nick. He was impressed. He had never thought of that before. He had always thought it was solitary drinking that made drunkards.

“没错，”尼克说。他印象深刻。他以前从未想过这一点。他一直认为孤独的饮酒是导致醉汉的原因。

“Well, he’s a doctor. My old man’s a painter. That’s different.”

“嗯，他是个医生。我父亲是个画家。这是不同的。”

“He’s missed a lot,” Nick said sadly.

“他错过了很多，”尼克悲伤地说。

“You can’t tell,” Bill said. “Everything’s got its compensations.”

“你不能说，”比尔说，“每件事都有它的补偿。”

“He says he’s missed a lot himself,” Nick confessed.

“他说他自己也错过了很多，”尼克坦白道。

“Once a man’s married he’s absolutely bitched,” Bill went on. “He hasn’t got anything more. Nothing. Not a damn thing. He’s done for. You’ve seen the guys that get married.”

比尔继续说道：“一旦男人结了婚，他就完蛋了。他什么都没有了。什么都没有。一无所有。他完蛋了。你见过那些结了婚的男人。”

“You can tell them,” Bill said. “They get this sort of fat married look. They’re done for.”

“你可以告诉他们，”比尔说，“他们有了这种胖胖的已婚人的样子。他们完蛋了。”

“Sure,” said Nick.

“当然，”尼克说。

“It was probably bad busting it off,” Bill said. “But you always fall for somebody else and then it’s all right. Fall for them but don’t let them ruin you.”

比尔说：“分手可能很糟糕，但你总是会爱上别人，然后一切都会好起来的。爱上他们，但不要让他们毁了你。”

“Yes,” said Nick.

“是的，”尼克说。

None of it was important now. The wind blew it out of his head. Still he could always go into town Saturday night. It was a good thing to have in reserve.

现在这些都无关紧要了。风把它吹出了他的脑海。尽管如此，他仍然可以在周六晚上去镇上。这是有备无患的好事。

 

**A Very Short Story**

Before he went back to the front they went into the Duomo and prayed. It was dim and quiet, and there were other people praying. They wanted to get married, but there was not enough time for the banns, and neither of them had birth certificates. They felt as though they were married, but they wanted everyone to know about it, and to make it so they could not lose it.

在他们回到前线之前，他们去了大教堂祈祷。那里光线昏暗，很安静，还有其他人也在祈祷。他们想结婚，但来不及申请结婚预告，而且他们俩都没有出生证明。他们觉得自己已经结婚了，但他们想让所有人都知道，这样他们就不会失去这段婚姻了。

He went to America on a boat from Genoa. Luz went back to Pordenone to open a hospital. It was lonely and rainy there, and there was a battalion of arditi quartered in the town. Living in the muddy, rainy town in the winter, the major of the battalion made love to Luz, and she had never known Italians before, and finally wrote to the States that theirs had been only a boy and girl affair. She was sorry, and she knew he would probably not be able to understand, but might someday forgive her, and be grateful to her, and she expected, absolutely unexpectedly, to be married in the spring. She loved him as always, but she realized now it was only a boy and girl love. She hoped he would have a great career, and believed in him absolutely. She knew it was for the best.

他乘船从热那亚去了美国。卢兹回到波代诺内开了一家医院。那里很冷清，而且多雨，有一支意大利突击队驻扎在镇上。他们住在冬天多雨泥泞的镇上，那支部队的指挥官勾引了卢兹，她以前从未接触过意大利人，最后给美国写信说，他们之间只是一场男欢女爱的风流韵事。她感到很抱歉，她知道他可能无法理解，但也许有一天会原谅她，并感激她，她绝对没想到的是，她会在春天结婚。她一如既往地爱他，但她现在意识到，那只是一场男欢女爱的风流韵事而已。她希望他事业有成，而且对他绝对有信心。她知道这是最好的结局。

 

**Soldier’s Home**

By the time Krebs returned to his home town in Oklahoma the greeting of heroes was over. He came back much too late. The men from the town who had been drafted had all been welcomed elaborately on their return. There had been a great deal of hysteria. Now the reaction had set in. People seemed to think it was rather ridiculous for Krebs to be getting back so late, years after the war was over.

At first Krebs, who had been at Belleau Wood, Soissons, the Champagne, St. Mihiel and in the Argonne did not want to talk about the war at all. Later he felt the need to talk but no one wanted to hear about it. His town had heard too many atrocity stories to be thrilled by actualities. Krebs found that to be listened to at all he had to lie, and after he had done this twice he, too, had a reaction against the war and against talking about it. A distaste for everything that had happened to him in the war set in because of the lies he had told. All of the times that had been able to make him feel cool and clear inside himself when he thought of them; the times so long back when he had done the one thing, the only thing for a man to do, easily and naturally, when he might have done something else, now lost their cool, valuable quality and then were lost themselves.

克雷布斯曾参加过贝劳森林战役、苏瓦松战役、香槟战役、圣米耶勒战役和阿贡战役。起初，他根本不想谈论战争。后来，他觉得有必要谈一谈，但没人想听。他的家乡已经听过太多暴行故事，对真实的故事不再感到震惊。克雷布斯发现，要想有人听他说话，他必须撒谎。他这样做了两次之后，他也对战争产生了反感，不想谈论战争。由于他撒了谎，他对战争期间发生在自己身上的所有事情都产生了反感。所有那些曾经让他在想起时感到内心平静和清醒的时光，所有那些他本来可以轻松自然地做别的事情，却做了唯一正确的事情的时光，现在都失去了它们宝贵的冷静和清晰，然后它们本身也消失了。

 

Nothing was changed in the town except that the young girls had grown up. But they lived in such a complicated world of already defined alliances and shifting feuds that Krebs did not feel the energy or the courage to break into it. 

镇上什么都没有变，除了那些年轻女孩已经长大了。但是她们生活在一个如此复杂的世界里，有着既定的联盟和变幻莫测的世仇，克雷布斯觉得没有精力和勇气去打破这种局面。

When he was in town their appeal to him was not very strong. He did not like them when he saw them in the Greek’s ice cream parlor. He did not want them themselves really. They were too complicated. There was something else. Vaguely he wanted a girl but he did not want to have to work to get her. He would have liked to have a girl but he did not want to have to spend a long time getting her. He did not want to get into the intrigue and the politics. He did not want to have to do any courting. He did not want to tell any more lies. It wasn’t worth it.

当他在镇上时，他们对他的吸引力并不强。当他看到他们在希腊人的冰淇淋店时，他并不喜欢他们。他并不真正想要他们。他们太复杂了。还有别的东西。他模糊地想要一个女孩，但他不想为了得到她而工作。他本想有一个女孩，但他不想花很长时间得到她。他不想卷入阴谋和政治。他不想求爱。他不想再撒谎了。这不值得。

 

He did not want any consequences. He did not want any consequences ever again. He wanted to live along without consequences. Besides he did not really need a girl. The army had taught him that. It was all right to pose as though you had to have a girl. Nearly everybody did that. But it wasn’t true. You did not need a girl. That was the funny thing. First a fellow boasted how girls mean nothing to him, that he never thought of them, that they could not touch him. Then a fellow boasted that he could not get along without girls, that he had to have them all the time, that he could not go to sleep without them.

他不想承担任何后果。他再也不想承担任何后果。他只想无忧无虑地活着。此外，他并不真的需要一个女孩。军队已经教会了他这一点。摆出一副需要女孩的样子是可以的，几乎每个人都是这么做的。但事实并非如此，你并不需要一个女孩。这真是个可笑的事情。起初，一个人吹嘘说，女孩对他来说毫无意义，他从未想过她们，她们无法触及他。然后，一个人吹嘘说，没有女孩他无法生活，他必须一直拥有她们，没有她们他无法入睡。

 

“Have you decided what you are going to do yet, Harold?” his mother said, taking off her glasses.

“你决定好要做什么了吗，哈罗德？”他妈妈摘下眼镜说道。

“No,” said Krebs.

“不，”克雷布斯说。

“Don’t you think it’s about time?” His mother did not say this in a mean way. She seemed worried.

“你难道不觉得是时候了吗？”他妈妈不是以一种刻薄的方式说的，她似乎很担心。

“I hadn’t thought about it,” Krebs said.

“我没有想过这个问题，”克雷布斯说。

“God has some work for everyone to do,” his mother said. “There can be no idle hands in His Kingdom.”

“上帝为每个人安排了工作，”他的母亲说，“在他的王国里，没有一只闲着的手。”

“I’m not in His Kingdom,” Krebs said.

“我不在他的王国里，”克雷布斯说。

“We are all of us in His Kingdom.”

“我们都在他的王国里。”

“I’m your mother,” she said. “I held you next to my heart when you were a tiny baby.”

“我是你的母亲，”她说，“当你还是个婴儿的时候，我把你抱在怀里。”

Krebs felt sick and vaguely nauseated.

克雷布斯感到恶心和轻微的恶心。

“I know, Mummy,” he said. “I’ll try and be a good boy for you.”

“我知道，妈妈，”他说，“我会尽量做一个好孩子。”

 

So his mother prayed for him and then they stood up and Krebs kissed his mother and went out of the house. He had tried so to keep his life from being complicated. Still, none of it had touched him. He had felt sorry for his mother and she had made him lie. He would go to Kansas City and get a job and she would feel all right about it. There would be one more scene maybe before he got away. He would not go down to his father’s office. He would miss that one. He wanted his life to go smoothly. It had just gotten going that way. Well, that was all over now, anyway. He would go over to the schoolyard and watch Helen play indoor baseball.

所以他妈妈为他祈祷，然后他们站起来，克雷布斯吻了母亲，然后走出家门。他一直努力使自己的生活简单化。尽管如此，这一切都没有触动他。他为他母亲感到难过，而她让他撒谎。他会去堪萨斯城找份工作，这样她就会好受些。在他离开之前可能还会有最后一幕。他不会去父亲的办公室。他会错过这一幕的。他希望自己的生活能顺利进行。一切才刚刚开始。好吧，不管怎样，现在一切都结束了。他会去学校操场，看海伦打室内棒球。

 

**The Revolutionist**

He loved the mountains in the autumn. The last I heard of him the Swiss had him in jail near Sion.

 

**Mr. and Mrs. Elliot**

Mr. and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby. They tried as often as Mrs. Elliot could stand it. They tried in Boston after they were married and they tried coming over on the boat. They did not try very often on the boat because Mrs. Elliot was quite sick. She was sick and when she was sick she was sick as Southern women are sick. That is women from the Southern part of the United States. Like all Southern women Mrs. Elliot disintegrated very quickly under sea sickness, travelling at night, and getting up too early in the morning. Many of the people on the boat took her for Elliot’s mother. Other people who knew they were married believed she was going to have a baby. In reality she was forty years old. Her years had been precipitated suddenly when she started travelling.

埃利奥特夫妇非常想要一个孩子。埃利奥特太太能忍受的次数，他们就尝试多少次。他们结婚后在波士顿尝试过，也尝试过坐船旅行时尝试过。他们坐船旅行时尝试的次数不多，因为埃利奥特太太身体很不舒服。她身体不舒服的时候，就像南方女人身体不舒服的时候一样。这是指来自美国南方的女人。和所有南方女人一样，埃利奥特太太在晕船、夜间旅行和起得太早的共同作用下，身体迅速垮掉。船上的很多人以为她是埃利奥特先生的母亲。其他知道他们是夫妻的人以为她怀孕了。实际上，她已经40岁了。当她开始旅行时，她的年龄突然变大了。

 

She had seemed much younger, in fact she had seemed not to have any age at all, when Elliot had married her after several weeks of making love to her after knowing her for a long time in her tea shop before he had kissed her one evening.

埃利奥特娶她时，她看上去要年轻得多，事实上，她看上去根本就没有年龄，埃利奥特在茶馆认识她后，经过好几个星期的做爱，才在一个晚上吻了她。

 

**Cat in the Rain**

He stood behind his desk in the far end of the dim room. The wife liked him. She liked the deadly serious way he received any complaints. She liked his dignity. She liked the way he wanted to serve her. She liked the way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands.

他站在昏暗房间尽头的办公桌后。妻子喜欢他。她喜欢他处理任何投诉时的严肃态度。她喜欢他的尊严。她喜欢他想为她服务的方式。她喜欢他作为酒店老板的感觉。她喜欢他苍老、粗壮的脸庞和大手。

 

“A cat?” the maid laughed. “A cat in the rain?”

“一只猫？”女仆笑了。“雨中的猫？”

“Yes,” she said, “under the table.” Then, “Oh, I wanted it so much. I wanted a kitty.”

“是的，”她说，“在桌子下面。”然后，“哦，我太想要它了。我想要一只小猫。”

 

In the doorway stood the maid. She held a big tortoise-shell cat pressed tight against her and swung down against her body.

门边站着女仆，她抱着一只大玳瑁猫，紧紧压在身上，猫的爪子搭在她身上。

“Excuse me,” she said, “the padrone asked me to bring this for the Signora.”

“对不起，”她说，“老板让我把这个带给夫人。”

 

**Out of Season**

They were walking down the hill toward the river. The town was in back of them. The sun had gone under and it was sprinkling rain. “There,” said Peduzzi, pointing to a girl in the doorway of a house they passed. “My daughter.”

他们沿着山坡向河边走去。镇子在他们身后。太阳已经落山，开始下起雨来。“看，”佩杜齐指着他们经过的房子门口的一个女孩说，“那是我女儿。”

“His doctor,” the wife said, “has he got to show us his doctor?”

“他的医生，”妻子说，“他必须向我们展示他的医生吗？”

“He said his daughter,” said the young gentleman.

“他说他的女儿，”年轻绅士说。

 

**Cross-Country Snow**

The girl came in and Nick noticed that her apron covered swellingly her pregnancy. I wonder why I didn’t see that when she first came in, he thought.

那个女孩走了进来，尼克注意到她的围裙遮住了隆起的腹部。我想，她第一次进来的时候，我为什么没有注意到呢，他心想。

 

**My Old Man**

And I came up and my old man acted just as though the two of them weren’t standing there and said, “Want an ice, Joe?” Holbrook looked down at my old man and said slow and careful, “You son of a bitch,” and he and the fat wop went out through the tables.

我走过去，我父亲就像那两个人并不在场一样，说道：“要来块冰吗，乔？”霍布鲁克低头看着我父亲，慢条斯理地说：“你这个混蛋，”然后他和那个胖大块头从桌子中间走了出去。

Then Gilford rolled over to one side off my old man and got up and started to run on three legs with his front off hoof dangling and there was my old man laying there on the grass flat out with his face up and blood all over the side of his head. I ran down the stand and bumped into a jam of people and got to the rail and a cop grabbed me and held me and two big stretcher-bearers were going out after my old man and around on the other side of the course I saw three horses, strung way out, coming out of the trees and taking the jump.

吉尔福德翻滚到我父亲身边，站了起来，三条腿一瘸一拐地继续向前跑去，它的前蹄悬在半空。我父亲躺在草地上，脸朝上，血流了一脸，一动也不动。我跑下看台，撞到一大群人，来到栏杆旁，一个警察抓住我，把我按住，两个抬担架的人跟着我父亲出去，在赛道的另一边，我看到三匹马，远远地排成一排，从树丛中出来，跳过障碍物。

My old man was dead when they brought him in and while a doctor was listening to his heart with a thing plugged in his ears, I heard a shot up the track that meant they’d killed Gilford. I lay down beside my old man, when they carried the stretcher into the hospital room, and hung onto the stretcher and cried and cried, and he looked so white and gone and so awfully dead, and I couldn’t help feeling that if my old man was dead maybe they didn’t need to have shot Gilford. His hoof might have got well. I don’t know. I loved my old man so much.

当他们把他抬进来时，我父亲已经死了。当一位医生用东西塞住耳朵听他的心脏时，我听到轨道上传来的枪声，这意味着他们杀了吉尔福德。当他们把担架抬进病房时，我躺在我父亲身边，抓着担架哭啊哭啊，他看起来那么苍白，那么憔悴，那么死气沉沉，我忍不住想，如果我父亲死了，也许他们就不需要杀吉尔福德了。他的蹄子可能会好起来的。我不知道。我非常爱我的父亲。

 

**Big Two-Hearted River: Part I**

Nick’s heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.

当鳟鱼移动时，尼克的心收紧了。他感到了一切旧的感觉。

It was hard work walking up-hill. His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy. He felt he had left everything behind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him.

爬山很辛苦。他的肌肉酸痛，而且天气很热，但尼克感到很开心。他觉得自己把一切都抛在身后，思考的需要，写作的需要，其他的需要。这些都离他远去了。

Now, as he watched the black hopper that was nibbling at the wool of his sock with its fourway lip, he realized that they had all turned black from living in the burned-over land. He realized that the fire must have come the year before, but the grasshoppers were all black now. He wondered how long they would stay that way.

现在，当他看着那只用四边嘴唇啃着他袜子羊毛的黑色跳蚤时，他意识到他们都因为生活在被烧毁的土地上而变黑了。他意识到火灾一定是前一年发生的，但现在蚱全黑了。他想知道他们会这样待多久。

He broke off some sprigs of the heathery sweet fern, and put them under his pack straps. The chafing crushed it and he smelled it as he walked.

 

**Big Two-Hearted River: Part II**

He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big watersmooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him. It went away slowly, the feeling of disappointment that came sharply after the thrill that made his shoulders ache. It was all right now. His rod lying out on the logs, Nick tied a new hook on the leader, pulling the gut tight until it grimped into itself in a hard knot.

他坐在圆木上，抽烟，在太阳下晒干，太阳温暖地照在他背上，前面的河水变浅了，进入树林，弯弯曲曲地进入树林，河水变浅了，波光粼粼，大石头很光滑，河岸上长着雪松和白桦树，圆木在太阳下很温暖，坐上去很舒服，没有树皮，摸上去是灰色的；渐渐地，失望的感觉离他而去。失望的感觉慢慢消失了，在刚才让他肩膀酸痛的高兴劲过去之后，这种失望的感觉变得很尖锐。现在没事了。他的钓竿放在圆木上，尼克在钓线上系了一个新鱼钩，把钓线拉得很紧，直到它自己打了个死结。

Ahead the river narrowed and went into a swamp. The river became smooth and deep and the swamp looked solid with cedar trees, their trunks close together, their branches solid. It would not be possible to walk through a swamp like that. The branches grew so low. You would have to keep almost level with the ground to move at all. You could not crash through the branches. That must be why the animals that lived in swamps were built the way they were, Nick thought.

前方河道变窄，进入一片沼泽地。河水变得又平又深，沼泽地长满了香柏树，树干挨着树干，树枝挨着树枝，结结实实。这样一片沼泽地根本无法穿行。树枝长得非常低，你几乎要紧贴着地面才能继续前进。你无法冲破树枝。尼克心想，这一定就是为什么沼泽地里生活的动物都长成这样。

He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading. He did not feel like going on into the swamp. He looked down the river. A big cedar slanted all the way across the stream. Beyond that the river went into the swamp.

他希望自己带了点东西来读。他想读点东西。他不想再走进沼泽了。他看着河对岸。一棵大雪松斜着穿过整个溪流。在那之后，河流流入沼泽。
